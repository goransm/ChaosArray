#Chaos Array

An array that can hold any type, and has  methods to insert and retrieve items at random index.

Custom exceptions are thrown if trying to insert something into a non-empty index, and when trying to retrieve an item from an empty index.

Currently uses for loops to insert and retrieve sample strings.
